# Bounded Buffer

The goal of this assignment is to write two programs in C/C++ using POSIX shared memory with a bounded buffer to 
demonstrate an interprocess communication mechanism between two cooperating processes. The first program named producer.c 
will produce information that is to be consumed by the second program named consumer.c.
